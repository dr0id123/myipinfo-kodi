Kodi / SPMC Plugin to display IP address info

Updated MetalKettles (unmaintained?) IP address info plugin to be functional.  This is useful to check/validate your IP address within Kodi / SPMC; such as when using a VPN.

Tested and works on SPMC 16 & Kodi 17.

Where possible, the following is displayed:
- External IP w/ hostname/city/country 
- Internal IP
